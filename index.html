            <p>My love,</p>
            <p>I know don’t say this enough, but I need you to know just how much you mean to me. You are my safe space, my constant, and the person who makes even the hardest days feel lighter. Being with you has taught me what love truly is—not just in words, but in the little things, the patience, the warmth, and the unwavering support you give me every day.</p>
            <p>I know I overthink, I worry, and sometimes, I let my doubts get the best of me. But through it all, you have been my rock. Your kindness, your understanding, and the way you make me feel loved, even when I struggle to love myself, mean more to me than I can ever put into words.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being patient with me. Thank you for standing by my side. Thank you for choosing me, even when things get difficult. I am so lucky to have you, and I want you to know that no matter what comes our way, I will always fight for us. You are my love, my home, and my happiness, and I cherish you more than I can ever express.</p>
            <p>I love you, Paras. With all my heart. Always. 💙</p>
            <p class="signature">Yours forever,<br>Moksha</p>
